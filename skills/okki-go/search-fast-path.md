# Search Fast Path

Read this for `L0_FAST_DISCOVERY` and `L0_PAGINATION`: ordinary company, buyer, importer, distributor, customer, target-account, or prospect search.

## Responsibilities

- Build one recall-first free `search-advanced` payload from the current user request.
- Keep the first visible result fast and compact.
- Use pagination before Expansion when the current route has more rows.
- Keep paid actions out of L0.

## L0 Flow

1. Run the auth check from `SKILL.md`.
2. Extract current-turn seller facts and target geography or buyer route.
3. Apply the Company Search Keyword Contract from `SKILL.md`.
4. Build a free company-search payload with a minimal keyword shape plus geography when supplied.
5. Run compact search.
6. Present the result using the company discovery contract in `output-contracts.md`.
7. Ask one next step: unlock selected rows, refine, or fetch more.

Do not run Mentor, Profile onboarding, Web Research, Expansion, viewed dedupe, or paid APIs before the first free search unless the user explicitly asked for that mode.

## No Web Fallback

L0 owns ordinary OKKI Go prospecting. If a company search has zero rows, noisy rows, network failure, timeout, 5xx, or system busy response, do not switch to public web search.

Allowed recovery actions are OKKI-only: retry once, split a batch into smaller requests, simplify Chinese target-side keywords, change one buyer route, remove over-narrow constraints, paginate, ask one clarifying question, or tell the user OKKI Go is temporarily unavailable and offer to retry later.

The wrapper scripts own the first transient retry for free company search. Do not add manual parallel retries around them. Batch discovery is serial by default to avoid tripping the upstream `searchPortraitRecall` flow-control resource.

## Constructible Search

A free company search is constructible when at least one target-company keyword field can be populated:

- `productKeywords`
- `companyTypeKeywords`
- `industryKeywords`

`includeCountry` and `excludeCountry` are filters only. They cannot be the whole search.

Ask a short question only when no target-company keyword can be built. If product/category is present but geography is missing, search globally unless the user's wording makes geography essential.

## Payload Rules

- Use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes.
- Use `size` from the user's requested count when practical; max API page size is 50.
- For requests over 20 rows, broad "more", or multi-page discovery, prefer `discover-companies-batch.js --compact`.
- Omit `withEmails` or set `0` unless email availability is central to the user's request.
- Do not default to `crossFieldOperator: "AND"`.
- Do not invent unsupported filters such as employee range, decision roles, website, homepage, contacts, URL, or limit.
- Treat importer/distributor/installer/employee/certification/decision-role hints as local display or recovery clues unless they are the chosen primary field.
- Do not pack product + role phrases into `companyTypeKeywords`; use `productKeywords` for products and one buyer role per company-type route.
- `size` and `from` do not reduce ES query rewrite clauses; if a route is too broad, change the keyword structure instead of only lowering pagination.
- Validation rejects compound company-type terms before API calls. Rewrite them into target-buyer profile keywords plus pure role terms; never replace them with copied seller product/SKU/model terms.

Example:

```json
{
  "productKeywords": ["汽车玻璃", "挡风玻璃", "车窗玻璃", "汽车配件"],
  "includeCountry": ["DE"],
  "from": 0,
  "size": 20
}
```

Product plus role example:

```json
{
  "productKeywords": ["汽车玻璃", "挡风玻璃"],
  "companyTypeKeywords": ["进口商"],
  "includeCountry": ["IN", "PK", "BD"],
  "from": 0,
  "size": 20
}
```

Compound company-type rewrite examples:

```json
{
  "companyTypeKeywords": ["控制系统工程商"]
}
```

Rewrite as:

```json
{
  "productKeywords": ["控制系统"],
  "companyTypeKeywords": ["工程商"],
  "includeCountry": ["IR"],
  "from": 0,
  "size": 20
}
```

## Recovery Budget

If the first result set is zero, sparse, noisy, or peer-supplier-heavy, use small free recovery before asking the user.

Default recovery order:

1. Rewrite the same route with better Chinese target-side index terms.
2. Shift one buyer route, such as distributor to installer or service provider.
3. Remove an over-narrow field such as email-only or `AND`.

Run at most one automatic recovery by default. The hard cap is three recovery searches for one user request, and only when each new payload is materially broader or cleaner than the previous one.

After the budget, show the best current rows or explain the route weakness with an executable next step. If low yield repeats, offer `L2_GUIDED_STRATEGY`.

## Pagination

Use compact output metadata before deciding:

- If `has_next_page=true`, or `next_offset` exists and is less than `available`, fetch the next page.
- If `discovery_health.health_action` or top-level `next_action` exists, follow that small action hint instead of re-deriving pagination or diagnosis from chat text.
- If the current route is exhausted and the user asks for another customer type or route, use `references/expansion-playbook.md`.
- If the user says the results are wrong, supplier-like, or too sparse, use `references/search-strategy.md`.

Do not infer hidden rows from chat text.

## Presentation

Use `output-contracts.md` as the single owner for company discovery display, field visibility, recommendation overlays, and debug metadata. L0 owns search construction and pagination decisions only.

After the table and any lightweight recommendation overlay, write the next-step guidance naturally in the user's language. Use `next_action` and `discovery_health` for pagination, low-yield, refinement, or unlock-selection guidance. For paid unlock row selections, use the script-provided `selection_handle` to prepare an unlock plan via `paid-actions.md`.
